## Feedback welcome!

Desert Witch is mainly tested on QML, Javascript, CSS and HTML, and is tweaked for the plugins I personally enjoy.

If you're readiding this:  
First, thank you for taking a moment to appreciate my personal love-letter to the color brown.  
Second: If you'd like to extend this theme, (or if you'd like me to do it!)
please, make some noise!
